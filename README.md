## About

Android example project showcasing retrofit consuming firebase data over REST calls. 

## Step 1 : create Android Studio sample project

I've picked Basic Activity from the available options. Any example project will do. It just provides you with the base structure for an Android App. 

## Step 2 : setp up 

The Views are in place already with the Activity (and Fragments) created withing the sample. For a true MVP implementation we need to add Presenters and Models. For maximum compliance with the MVP pattern approach we'll also create View interfaces that our Activities and Fragments will implement.
